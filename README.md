# Movie-Recommender
Recommendation systems have become increasingly popular these days. Because of their ability to predict the rating or preference for a particular item they have found a broad scope of application in domains like restaurants,movies,online shopping and so on.
This project is a demonstration of a content based movie recommendation system.
Content based filtering uses attributes of the content to recommend similar content.
Similarity is the fundamental key in these recommendation systems.A most similar thing to what we are currently watching gets recommended to us.
There are different techniques or similarity measures that are used to compute the similarity like Euclidean distance,Cosine similarity
